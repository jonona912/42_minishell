// function to simply seperate functions to executables
// name of the executable
// redirection struct (0 - no_redirection, 1 - input redirection, 2 - output redirection here-doc...)
// // name of the redirection file *str
// char **argv for the executable if any (always contains the name of the executable) 


// if it needs to pipe its output to another command then pipe it then which of the pipes
// if the result needs to be piped to another command
special function to handle pipes???




example:
echo 'Today is $(date +%A)' | grep "Today is"

node->value = echo
	node->echo_node->value = 'Today is $(date +%A)'

linked list of each token until a null is reached
// size of current_token = length of the total string...


store everything in token_lst
